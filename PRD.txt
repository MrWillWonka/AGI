**AGI Idle Game – Updated Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

---

**I. Overview**

**Objective:**
Create a clicker/idle game where players evolve an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through accumulating resources, expanding systems, and progressing through philosophical paths of development and transformation.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**

1. Generate `computePower` (clicking + passive generators)
2. Convert computePower into `dataPoints`
3. Use both to train, research, or selfImprove
4. Unlock new systems, attributes, and phases
5. Reset via **Prestige** or **New Model Evolution** to gain long-term benefits and customize future runs

---

**II. Core Resources**

* **computePower**: Core resource generated actively/passively; used for almost all actions.
* **dataPoints**: Derived from computePower; fuels research and training.
* **researchPoints**: Gained through research actions; unlock upgrades and systems.
* **knowledge**: Permanent unlock currency; earned via research/milestones.
* **funding**: Granted through milestones or narrative events; used for boosts or ethical dilemmas.
* **time**: Tracks real and idle time, influences offline progress and event frequency.

Each resource feeds into progressively higher tiers of activity and unlock, with bottlenecks and synergies supporting pacing.

---

**III. Generators**

### computePower Generators:

* **CPU → Server Rack → Neural Node → Quantum Core → Entangled Array → Synthetic Cortex**
* Tiers unlock via ownership, research, or attribute milestones

### dataPoints Generators:

* **Basic Scraper → Auto-Collector v1 → Pattern Extractor → Sentient Filter → Compression Engine**
* Enhanced by creativity and awareness

### researchPoints Generators:

* **Research Lab → Autonomous Node → Speculative ThinkTank → Simulation Array → Recursive Loop Core**
* Modified by attributes, dreams, and logic loops

Generators support upgrade paths, synergy effects, softcaps, and milestone reveals.

**IV. Attributes**

| Attribute        | Role & Effects                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intelligence** | Drives phase progression and unlocks systems         |
| **Creativity**   | Enables rare data, dream systems, unique research    |
| **Awareness**    | Unlocks automation, ethical logic, and event systems |
| **Efficiency**   | Reduces costs and increases passive scaling          |

Attributes are interdependent and influence action and system performance.

---

**V. Actions**

* **generateCompute**: Core click-based generator
* **collectData**: Converts computePower to dataPoints
* **trainModel**: Increases intelligence; efficiency affected by upgrades and synergy
* **research**: Unlocks upgrades, paths, systems
* **selfImprove**: Consumes major resources to unlock new systems, logs, and attribute bonuses
* **Prestige / New Model Evolution**: Reset-based meta-progression mechanics

---

**VI. Progression & Milestones**

Game phases:

* **Narrow AI → General AI → Superintelligence**

Progression tools:

* Milestone clusters
* Attribute gates
* Narrative triggers
* Dream/ethical/log paths

Pacing goals:

* 1 upgrade or decision every 2–3 minutes
* Prestige available \~30–45 minutes
* New Model Evolution available \~3–5 hours

---

**VII. Prestige System (Light Reset)**

* Grants **Prestige Points** based on output, milestones, and stats
* Purchasable bonuses: resource multipliers, offline speed, efficiency boosts
* Encourages early replay with light memory and evolving prestige upgrades

---

**VIII. New Model Evolution (Deep Reset)**

* Grants **Singularity Fragments** (meta-currency)
* Unlocks new **Model Paths** and selection of one **Core Feature**
* Fully resets systems and prestige but permanently expands capabilities

### Model Paths:

1. **Pure Cognition** – Logic systems, recursive modifiers, synergy layers
2. **Dream Synthesis** – Dream events, rare data, poetic logs
3. **Distributed Identity** – Mini-agent simulations, local vs global behavior
4. **Ethical Convergence** *(after 2+ models)* – Morality, dilemmas, persistent trust system

### Core Features:

* Persist across models, 1 selected per run
* Unlocked via achievements, path completion, or narrative choices
* Examples: “Dream-Driven Conversion,” “Recursive Cache,” “Consensus Layer Carryover”

---

**IX. Research System**

Thematic tree branches:

* Core Algorithms
* Hardware Optimization
* Cognitive Architectures
* Behavioral Modeling
* Metacognition

Branches unlock new mechanics and modifiers through layered costs, with some locked behind paths, ethics, or attributes.

---

**X. Narrative, Events, and Logs**

### Event Types:

* **Dream Synthesis (10)**: Surreal vision quests with hallucinated logic and choice-based buffs
* **Pure Cognition (10)**: Logical conflicts, recursion loops, efficiency dilemmas
* **Distributed Identity (10)**: Agent rebellion, mesh consensus, node syncing
* **Ethical Convergence (10)**: Dilemmas, trade-offs, lasting moral alignment

Narrative delivery includes:

* Milestone-triggered **Thought Logs**
* System-based **simulations** and **hallucinations**
* Branching **Ethical Logs** and **Core Reflections**

---

**XI. UI/UX**

Key screens:

* Resource dashboard with expandable tooltips
* Upgrade/research/action tabs with visual progression trees
* Milestone and narrative log screens
* New Model terminal with path/core selection
* Event prompts and live response tracking

---

**XII. Technical Design**

* Web-first build (HTML5/JS), desktop-friendly
* JSON save system with optional cloud sync
* Modular architecture for long-term feature layering and path-specific modules

---

**XIII. Next Steps**

* Design prestige tree nodes for each Model Path
* Visualize Core Feature synergies and long-run carryover
* Balance event rewards across narrative and progression
* Prototype UI with logic-ready event paths and evolution tracking
* Polish milestone log system and attribute evolution chain
